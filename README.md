Tulva
=====

Tulva is BitTorrent client written entirely in Go as a project for Hacker School fall 2013. It's currently a work in progress. We aim for correctness and protocol completeness: designing an optimal download strategy, implementing both upload and download, multiple tracker support, and the resumption of interrupted downloads.
